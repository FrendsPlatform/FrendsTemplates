- [ ] Process end points like error throws and return statements have titles (double-click) and reasonable information.
  - [ ] Results have good summaries, preferably with statistics of some sort like "processed X files"
  - [ ] Errors have some error info, usually from task (e.g. some ErrorMessage property contains additional error info)
  - [ ] Errors are pointed downwards from their respective source, e.g. an exclusive decision
- [ ] Process is organised with groups (dashed boxes)
- [ ] Straight lines are preferred where possible
- [ ] Subprocesses are forbidden
- [ ] Text mode is preferred over Expressions in expressions, e.g. instead of *$"This is {#var.error}"* use *This is {{#var.error}}*
- [ ] Process metadata file is present and content is fine (version number and name)

- [ ] Process description file is present (all sections filled in)

- [ ] Markdown paragraphs are separated with two newlines, so there is a blank line inbetween two paragraphs
- [ ] If some system is integrated using e.g. a HTTP task (meaning we do not use a native connector for the system), then the system should be mentioned in additional systems used in metadata.json
- [ ] If the template is handling some sample JSON data - make sure that the sample data is included in the long description (just one-two elements is enough)
- [ ] If the template is assuming that there is a database table ready for data insertion / updates - include the table structure in the long description as a `CREATE TABLE` scipt.
